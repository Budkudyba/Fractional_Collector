# Fractional_Collector

A novel spin on fractional collection.  
  
Based upon the Ramps 1.4 board and Arduino Mega for 3D printers. DRV8825 Stepper Drivers were used.
  
The sampler takes samples based upon a RTC (real-time clock).  
  
The sampler has two attached parastaltic pumps with stepper motors and a sample tray which is also powered by a stepper motor.  
The sample tray has room for 64 small eppendorf (1.5 mL).  
  
Here's a version of the sampler to show the basic form:
