# Fractional_Collector

A novel spin on fractional collection.

Based upon the Ramps 1.4 board for 3D printers.

The sampler takes samples based upon a RTC (real-time clock).

The sampler has two attached parastaltic pumps with stepper motors and a tray which is also powered by a stepper motor.

The project is completed, but there will be updates upcoming to include a BOM, STL files, CAD files, and documentation.

I may rewite this code to remove dependancies on the arduino compiler and/or #include libraries but for simplicity and time constrainst this was the fastest way to code and build the project.

Here's a version of the sampler to show the basic form
